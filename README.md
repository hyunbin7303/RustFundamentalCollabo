# Rust Study Collaboration
The purpose of this repository is to study the grammar and syntax of Rust and figure out how it operates. Instead of studying alone, it would be great if I could share what I've learned with others. Ultimately, I aim to create a vast library of code that we can use as a reference whenever we need to review it.

## Rust Characteristics
* Statically typed programming languages(type checking at compile time)
* Variables are immutable by default. Use `mut` keyword if you want to make variables mutable.
* Memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks.
* No Null pointers, no data races and no buffer overflows.

## Contributing
There is no specific contributing guide line yet so if you want to add up more codes for studying Rust, please create a ticket and request PR! if you have questions? Anything you would like to study together? Create a discussions to talk about all sorts of topics in regards to Rust Grammar(Or Library)!
